# ArgonCubeSC
Program and scripts for the data acquisition and data analysis for the ArgonCube slow control. The code is not a single software/framework to be installed, but rather a collection of scripts, libraries (mostly python files), and analysis notebooks used for data collection and data analysis of the slow control data of ArgonCube divided, when possible, in different data runs.
